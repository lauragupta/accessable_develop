# accessible_develop

The goal for this client is to have an accessible website that uses semantic elements in a quality structure. It has sequential headings and a new title. 

I changed the title to Horiseon. Then I changed several div tags to more specific and semantic elements like header, nav, aside, and footer and changed the corresponding css when appropriate. I added alt codes for all images in the html. 

I also consolidated styling for several elements that all had the same style tags. 

## Features

This project required keeping the visiual layout exactly the same, while cleaning up the code. So this site continues to look as it did before.
